The world outside was a symphony of new smells – exhaust fumes, damp leaves, the tantalizing aroma of freshly baked bread. She navigated the busy street with surprising confidence, weaving between legs and darting under parked cars. Her destination? The park, a green oasis she had only glimpsed from the safety of her window.\n",

She was still Clementine, the tabby cat, but she was also something more: Clementine, the rescuer, the explorer, the hero of the park. And that, she knew, was an adventure worth having.\n",

It's often called `bash-git-prompt` or similar.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **What it does:** The script dynamically updates your prompt to show things like the current branch name, the status of tracked and untracked files, whether you have uncommitted changes, if you're ahead or behind the remote, and more.  It uses colors to highlight different states and make the information easily glanceable. It also handles virtual environment prompts for python/node/conda.\n\n*   **Why use it:**\n    *   **Git Status at a Glance:**  Instead of constantly running `git status`, you see the essential information right in your prompt.\n    *   **Improved Workflow:**  Reduces the mental overhead of working with Git, making you more efficient.\n    *   **Customization:**  The script is highly customizable, allowing you to choose which information to display, the colors to use, and the overall style of the prompt.\n    *   **Context Awareness:**  Immediately see if you're in a clean state, if you have changes to commit, or if you're out of sync with the remote repository.\n    *   **Virtual Environment awareness**: The prompt will also indicate if a virtual environment is active.\n\nIn essence, this script transforms your command prompt from a simple text string into a powerful, real-time Git status dashboard. You would typically use it by sourcing it in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file, which means adding a line like `source /path/to/this/script.sh` to the file that configures your shell. Then open a new terminal or reload the shell's configuration file using `source ~/.bashrc`\n"
